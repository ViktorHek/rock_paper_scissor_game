# Rock, Paper Scissor Game - Pokemon Edition

## Description
This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game as part of a challenge from the Craft Academy bootcamp. The challenge was simply to create an Rock, paper, Scissor game with no additional instructions. The ide was that we, the student, would have to think for our self and be creative when finding a solution to the challenge. My creativity stepped in when I choose to replace the traditional rock, paper and scissor to a fire pokemon, water pokemon and a grass pokemon. 

The game is simple. You pick a pokemon based on it's element. If an element is super effective against another, then the pokemon with that element wins. witch means fire wins against grass, grass wins against water and water wins against fire. If you and your opponent chooses the same pokemon the game will tell you that "Pokemons don't fight there friends", meaning it's a tie. Both you and your opponent starts with the pokemon Ditto. Ditto only have one ability, to transform in to another pokemon. you choose if you want your Ditto to transform in to a fire, water ore grass pokemon and then you press the button that says Figth! Your opponents pokemon will be a random pokemon between the three options. it will also go through 5 options in 1 second before making it's pick. depending on your and the computers choice it will give you one out of three messages:

* "You are the Champion" - if you win
* "Pokemons don't fight there friends" - if you tie
* "You lose!" - if you lose
